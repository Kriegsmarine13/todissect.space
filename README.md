Anime Community WebSite

Hi everyone. Though I am a lamer I am pretty obsessed both with anime and programming. So I decided to start my very first serious project!
todissect.space (2DSect) Is a web portal about anime and everything connected to it (even comics). Main target - is to cover all the news 
of anime/manga world in a simple way and trying to be as fast as possible at it. Second target - is to give all talented fans some space
to show others their skills. For that reasons I am making sections 'Artists', 'Blogs', 'Comics', 'Manga' and 'Reviews'. Everyone here will
be able to contact each other for further cooperation. Next step is to get serious. I plan to open a Publishing House and (somehow, lol) 
publish the most successful works of our collection. 

Tech part is growing by demands: I use common PHP(5.6)-HTML-CSS-JS stack. I'm coming to part where I need an advanced skill in JS (which I don't
have) and basic AJAX. Yet, I use only one plugin - dropzone.js for d'n'd image uploads

To be short
Aims:
-Anime News Highlight
-Place to grow talents
-Start publishing

Needs:
-Web programmers (mostly front end)
-Content-creators
-Translators (JP-EN, JP-RU)

Also, if you're running or trying to start a Youtube channel or any other info/art resource on the same thematic as we do - be free to 
contact me and we will help each other to enlarge our auditory!
